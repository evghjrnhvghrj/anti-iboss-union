vent: first period in class doing a project

The project was making a band logo so obviously my friend went onto a logo maker he did the among us character  (ඞ)  
and when he finished making it he decided to click the share button and it gave him a option to share with a link
X,reddit,tik tok, and Facebook and i don’t know why but he clicked X and it worked no banning, so i tried the same thing
and i got banned so then he tried reddit and agen it worked and i tried it banned me then the realization came to me we 
have a way around iboss!! So we decided to try tik tok and it worked we also tried some old banned websites and those 
worked so we tried his settings and they didn't work here is how we did it we went to chrome://extensions and we clicked
details and then site setting we copped him everything blocked but that didn’t work so we clicked extensions options and
we checked the settings and it was the same but i forgot one, one important thing, he was connected to PYLUSD-BYOD, but 
it only lasted for 30 minutes then it stopped working and we still do not know about how he activated it so that's why we
are researching how it happened and trying to recreate the anomaly and we need your help to do it and help us find a way 
because from that anomaly we found out THERE IS A WAY.
